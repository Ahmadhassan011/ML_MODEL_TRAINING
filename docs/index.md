## Features

=== "Data Generation"

    The pipeline generates synthetic data for a linear regression task. This allows for quick experimentation and testing without the need for external datasets.

=== "Preprocessing"

    The data is automatically split into training and testing sets, ensuring a proper evaluation of the model.

=== "Model Training"

    A simple linear regression model is trained on the data using PyTorch's `nn.Module`.

=== "Evaluation"

    The trained model is evaluated on the test set to assess its performance.

=== "Prediction"

    The trained model can be used to make predictions on new data points.
