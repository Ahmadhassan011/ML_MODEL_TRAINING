# Welcome to the Simple ML Pipeline

This project provides a basic, end-to-end machine learning pipeline that demonstrates a simple linear regression model. The pipeline is built with Python and utilizes PyTorch for the model creation and training.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to showcase a simple yet complete machine learning workflow, including:

- **Data Generation:** Synthetic data is generated for a linear regression task.
- **Preprocessing:** The data is split into training and testing sets.
- **Model Training:** A simple linear regression model is trained on the data.
- **Evaluation:** The trained model is evaluated on the test set.
- **Prediction:** The trained model can be used to make predictions on new data points.
- **Command-Line Interface:** A CLI is provided to run the pipeline with different parameters.
- **Documentation:** The project is documented using MkDocs, with automatic documentation generation from docstrings.

This project serves as a basic template that can be extended for more complex machine learning tasks.
